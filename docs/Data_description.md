## 1. Dataset
Dataset contains 59911 images taken from flying-cam devices (Phantom 4 RTK) with very high resolutions in range of 12-20 Mpx. The captured areas include mountains, forests and flats. For safety, the images were captured at least 5 meters from the devices with many different shooting angles. Then, they were automatically uploaded and labeled using our system. The dataset is composed of 26 components as described in Table 1.
